## Simple dashboard for local environment

This directory provides a simple data visualization tool for those who want to check in their local environment or do not have a visualization environment (planned).

This visualization tool will use Prometheus for data storage. You can also use your own Prometheus, but to support OTLP, you need to enable OTLP with the experimental flag or use version 3 or higher.
